# Assignment 2: Machine Learning
We have decided to use regression as the algorithm because we are working with continuous values as opposed to categories/classes. As the task specifies we want to predict number of average passengers on a arbitrary date for a specific bus. For this we have choosen bus 100, purely because this is the bus with the most dataentries, and therefor has the highest number of datapoints to train the regression with. For this dataset the differences were minimal but we still ended up utilizing a third degree polynomial regression to get that litle edge over a linear one.
