# Assignment 2: Machine Learning
We have decided to use regression as algorithm because we are working with continuous values as opposed to categories/classes. As the task specifies we want to predict number of average passengers on a specific date and bus. For this dataset the differences were minimal but we still ended up utilizing a third degree polynomial regression to get that litle edge over a linear one.
